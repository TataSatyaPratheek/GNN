# Building Block: Graph Neural Network Architecture

## Conceptual Overview

The Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture is a central building block of the paper, providing the computational framework for learning from graph-structured process maps. The authors employ a specialized GNN design that incorporates message passing, attention mechanisms, and norm-based feature representations.

## Mathematical Foundation

### General GNN Framework

The core idea of GNNs is to learn node representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes through an iterative process. For a node $v$, its representation at layer $t+1$ is computed as:

$$\mathbf{h}_v^{(t+1)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}_t \cdot \text{AGGREGATE}(\{\mathbf{m}_{u\rightarrow v} | u \in \mathcal{N}_v\})\right)$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}$ is the feature vector of node $v$ at layer $t$
- $\mathcal{N}_v$ is the set of neighboring nodes of $v$
- $\mathbf{m}_{u\rightarrow v}$ is the message from node $u$ to $v$
- AGGREGATE is a permutation-invariant function (e.g., sum, mean, max)
- $\mathbf{W}_t$ is a learnable weight matrix
- $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function

### Specific Architecture in the Paper

The paper employs a Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant with several enhancements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Node features: $\mathbf{h}_v^{(0)} = \mathbf{x}_v$ (task attributes)
   - Edge features: $\mathbf{e}_{uv}$ (dependency attributes)

2. **Message Passing**:
   - Message function: $\mathbf{m}_{u\rightarrow v} = f_m(\mathbf{h}_u^{(t)}, \mathbf{e}_{uv})$
   - Attention-weighted aggregation (see Multi-head Attention building block)

3. **Update Function**:
   - Norm-based update: $\mathbf{h}_v^{(t+1)} = \sigma\left(\frac{\mathbf{W}_t \cdot \mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}}{\|\mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}\|_p + \epsilon} + \mathbf{h}_v^{\text{agg}}\right)$
   - Where $\mathbf{h}_v^{\text{agg}}$ is the aggregated information from neighboring nodes

4. **Output Layer**:
   - Task classification: $\hat{y}_v = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_{\text{out}} \cdot \mathbf{h}_v^{(L)})$
   - Cycle time prediction: $\hat{T}_v = \mathbf{w}_{\text{time}}^T \cdot \mathbf{h}_v^{(L)}$

## Architectural Components

### 1. GNN Layers

The network consists of multiple GNN layers, each performing message passing and feature updates. The number of layers $L$ determines the receptive field of each node, with $L=3$ allowing nodes to incorporate information from 3-hop neighbors.

### 2. Attention Mechanism

The paper employs multi-head attention (see separate building block) to focus on relevant dependencies:

$$\alpha_{uv}^k = \frac{\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}_k^T \cdot [\mathbf{W}_q^k\mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}||\mathbf{W}_k\mathbf{h}_u^{(t)}]\right)\right)}{\sum_{w\in\mathcal{N}_v}\exp\left(\text{LeakyReLU}\left(\mathbf{a}_k^T \cdot [\mathbf{W}_q^k\mathbf{h}_v^{(t)}||\mathbf{W}_k\mathbf{h}_w^{(t)}]\right)\right)}$$

Where $\mathbf{a}_k$ is a learnable attention vector, and $||$ denotes concatenation.

### 3. Residual Connections

To mitigate over-smoothing in deep GNNs, residual connections are employed:

$$\mathbf{h}_v^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{h}_v^{(t)} + \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}_t \cdot \text{AGGREGATE}(\{\mathbf{m}_{u\rightarrow v} | u \in \mathcal{N}_v\})\right)$$

### 4. Dropout and Normalization

To improve generalization:
- Dropout is applied to node features: $\mathbf{h}_v^{\text{drop}} = \text{Dropout}(\mathbf{h}_v, p)$
- Layer normalization is used: $\mathbf{h}_v^{\text{norm}} = \text{LayerNorm}(\mathbf{h}_v)$

## Task-Specific Adaptations

### 1. Next-Activity Prediction

For predicting the next activity, the final node representations are fed into a classifier:

$$P(\text{next activity} = a_j | \text{current} = a_i) = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_{\text{class}} \cdot \mathbf{h}_i^{(L)})_j$$

### 2. Cycle Time Regression

For predicting task durations or cycle times:

$$\hat{T}_v = \mathbf{w}_{\text{time}}^T \cdot \mathbf{h}_v^{(L)}$$

### 3. Bottleneck Detection

Bottlenecks are identified using node embeddings and connectivity patterns:

$$\text{Bottleneck Score}_v = f(\mathbf{h}_v^{(L)}, \{\mathbf{h}_u^{(L)} | u \in \mathcal{N}_v\})$$

## Training and Optimization

The GNN is trained using a combination of task-specific losses:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{workflow}} + \beta\mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}}$$

With:
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ focusing on node-level predictions
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{workflow}}$ capturing graph-level objectives
- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{regularization}}$ ensuring smooth embeddings

## Scalability Considerations

For large process maps, the authors implement:
1. **Mini-batch training**: Processing subsets of nodes per iteration
2. **Neighbor sampling**: Randomly selecting a subset of neighbors for message passing
3. **Layer-wise sampling**: Using different sampling strategies at different GNN layers
