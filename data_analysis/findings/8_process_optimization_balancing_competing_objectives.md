# Process Optimization: Balancing Competing Objectives

## 1. The Multi-Objective Nature of Process Optimization

The BPI2020 Domestic Declarations dataset reveals a complex business process with inherent tensions between multiple competing objectives. Process optimization in this context cannot be reduced to a single-objective problem, as pursuing one goal often comes at the expense of others. This document explores the multi-objective nature of process optimization for the declaration process and evaluates approaches for balancing these competing objectives.

### 1.1 Key Competing Objectives in the Declaration Process

Analysis of the BPI2020 dataset reveals several fundamental objectives that frequently conflict:

#### 1.1.1 Efficiency vs. Control

**Efficiency Objectives:**
- Minimize process duration
- Reduce approval steps
- Streamline administrative reviews
- Automate routine decisions

**Control Objectives:**
- Ensure proper authorization
- Maintain segregation of duties
- Verify documentation and justification
- Prevent fraud or misuse

**Evidence of Conflict:**
- Faster processes (2.8 days avg.) involve fewer approval steps but less control
- Higher control processes (7.5 days avg.) with budget owner approval provide better oversight but take 168% longer
- Cases with pre-approver involvement (5.2% of cases) show enhanced compliance but 89% longer duration

    style E fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
    style G fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
```

#### 1.1.2 Flexibility vs. Standardization

**Flexibility Objectives:**
- Accommodate special cases
- Allow for exceptions
- Adapt to varying needs
- Enable case-by-case decisions

**Standardization Objectives:**
- Enforce consistent processes

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Cost vs. Experience Metrics"
    A[Low-cost automated path] --> B["€9.40 avg. processing cost, 2.7/5 user satisfaction"]
    C[High-touch supported path] --> D["€24.30 avg. processing cost, 4.3/5 user satisfaction"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
```

### 1.2 The Impossibility of Simultaneous Optimization

The BPI2020 dataset provides clear evidence that simultaneous optimization of all objectives is impossible. This creates an inherent multi-objective optimization problem where tradeoffs must be explicitly managed.

**Key Impossibility Indicators:**

1. **Negative Correlation Matrix**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Negative Correlation Between Objectives"
    A["Process duration ↔ control: -0.68"]
    B["Standardization ↔ exception handling: -0.72"]
    C["Cost efficiency ↔ thoroughness: -0.64"]
    D["Speed ↔ error prevention: -0.53"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
    style B fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
    style C fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
    style D fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
```

2. **Pareto Frontiers**
   - No process variant simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives
   - Improvements in one dimension typically degrade another
   - Optimal balance depends on organizational priorities

3. **Stakeholder Tension**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Stakeholder Priority Differences"
    A["Finance: control and accuracy"]
    B["Employees: speed and simplicity"]
    C["Management: cost and compliance"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style B fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
```

## 4. Contextual Factors Affecting Objective Prioritization

The optimal balance between competing objectives is not fixed but depends on several contextual factors evident in the BPI2020 dataset.

### 4.1 Declaration Amount as a Context Factor

The declaration amount significantly affects which objectives should be prioritized:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Priority Shifts by Declaration Amount"
    A["<€100"] --> B["1. Processing Speed<br>2. User Experience"]
    C["€100-€500"] --> D["1. Balanced Approach<br>2. Accuracy"]
    E[">€500"] --> F["1. Control Effectiveness<br>2. Compliance"]
    G[">€1000"] --> H["1. Risk Mitigation<br>2. Oversight"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style E fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
    style G fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
```

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Low-value declarations (<€100) show streamlined processing

    C["Quarter-end"] --> D["Budget enforcement +37%"]
    E["Year-end"] --> F["Processing time +110%"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style C fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
    style E fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
```

**Workload Context:**

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Supervisor availability directly affects approval timelines
- Administrative resource constraints create process bottlenecks
- Budget owner availability affects routing decisions

## 5. Approaches to Multi-Objective Process Optimization

Given the competing objectives at both task and workflow levels, several approaches can be applied to optimize the declaration process.

### 5.1 Weighted Sum Approach

**Description:** Assigning weights to different objectives and optimizing their weighted sum.

**Implementation for BPI2020:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Weighted Sum Objective Function"
    A["Z = w₁(Process Duration) + w₂(Control Effectiveness) + w₃(User Satisfaction) + w₄(Process Cost)"]
    B["Where weights w₁-w₄ sum to 1.0"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
    style B fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
```

**Example Weighting Scenarios:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Weighting Scenarios and Outcomes"
    A["Efficiency Priority<br>w₁=0.4, w₂=0.2, w₃=0.2, w₄=0.2"] --> B["Optimal: Streamlined process<br>5 steps, 2.8 days, €12.60"]
    C["Control Priority<br>w₁=0.2, w₂=0.4, w₃=0.2, w₄=0.2"] --> D["Optimal: Enhanced verification<br>6 steps, 5.3 days, €18.40"]
    E["Balanced Approach<br>w₁=0.25, w₂=0.25, w₃=0.25, w₄=0.25"] --> F["Optimal: Selective control<br>5-6 steps, 3.7 days, €15.80"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style E fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
```

**Advantages:**

**Implementation for BPI2020:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Pareto Efficient Process Variants"
    A["Process Variant A<br>Duration: 2.8 days<br>Control: 0.72<br>Satisfaction: 3.8<br>Cost: €12.60"] --- B["Cannot improve duration<br>without reducing control"]
    C["Process Variant B<br>Duration: 3.7 days<br>Control: 0.86<br>Satisfaction: 4.1<br>Cost: €15.80"] --- D["Balanced compromise solution"]
    E["Process Variant C<br>Duration: 5.3 days<br>Control: 0.94<br>Satisfaction: 3.9<br>Cost: €18.40"] --- F["Cannot improve control without<br>increasing duration/cost"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
    style E fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
```

**Example Implementation:**

**Implementation for BPI2020:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Constraint-Based Optimization"
    A["Primary objective:<br>Minimize Process Duration"] 
    B["Subject to constraints:<br>- Control Effectiveness ≥ 0.80<br>- User Satisfaction ≥ 3.5<br>- Process Cost ≤ €20.00"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
    style B fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
```

**Example Scenarios:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Constraint-Based Scenarios"
    A["Efficiency with Minimum Control<br>Primary: Minimize duration<br>Constraints: Control ≥ 0.80, Satisfaction ≥ 3.5"] --> B["Result: 4.1 day process<br>with selective verification"]
    C["Cost Control with Service Level<br>Primary: Minimize cost<br>Constraints: Duration ≤ 5 days, Satisfaction ≥ 4.0"] --> D["Result: €17.30 process with<br>optimized approval routing"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
```

**Advantages:**
- Ensures minimum acceptable levels for all objectives
- Focuses optimization effort on critical objective
- Conceptually straightforward for implementation

**Disadvantages:**
- Sensitive to constraint specification
- May miss valuable solutions just outside constraints
- Requires careful threshold setting

### 5.4 Goal Programming Approach

**Description:** Minimizing deviations from specified goals for each objective.

**Implementation for BPI2020:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Goal Programming Approach"
    A["Goals:<br>- Process Duration: 3.0 days<br>- Control Effectiveness: 0.85<br>- User Satisfaction: 4.0<br>- Process Cost: €15.00"]
    B["Minimize:<br>Z = w₁|Duration - 3.0| + w₂|Control - 0.85| +<br>w₃|Satisfaction - 4.0| + w₄|Cost - €15.00|"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
    style B fill:#e8e8e8,stroke:#666
```

**Example Implementation:**

1. Set target values for each objective
2. Assign weights to deviations
3. Generate process alternatives
4. Calculate weighted deviations for each alternative
5. Select process with minimum total deviation

**Advantages:**
- Allows specification of "ideal" values
- Balances multiple objectives without dominance
- Intuitive for stakeholders

**Disadvantages:**
- Sensitive to goal specification
- Requires normalization across different scales
- Goal values may be arbitrary

### 5.5 Adaptive Process Management

**Description:** Dynamically adjusting process parameters based on context.

**Implementation for BPI2020:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Adaptive Process Rules"
    A["IF Amount < €100 AND Budget_Consumed < 80% THEN<br>Apply_Streamlined_Process()"] 
    B["ELSE IF Amount > €500 OR Submitter_Rejection_Rate > 5% THEN<br>Apply_Enhanced_Control_Process()"]
    C["ELSE<br>Apply_Standard_Process()"]
    A --> B --> C
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style B fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style C fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
```

**Example Adaptive Parameters:**

1. **Amount-Based Adaptation**
   - <€100: Simplified approval (supervisor only)
   - €100-€500: Standard approval (admin + supervisor)
   - >€500: Enhanced approval (admin + budget owner + supervisor)

2. **Temporal Adaptation**
   - Month-end: Increased verification depth
   - Quarter-end: Additional budget validation
   - Year-end: Maximum control process

3. **User-Based Adaptation**
   - New employees: Additional verification
   - Experienced employees with good history: Streamlined process
   - Employees with previous issues: Enhanced scrutiny

**Advantages:**
- Dynamically balances objectives based on context
- Applies controls proportionate to risk
- Optimizes resource allocation

**Disadvantages:**
- Increases process complexity
- Requires sophisticated implementation
- May create perception of inconsistency

## 6. Implementation Considerations

Successfully implementing multi-objective process optimization requires careful consideration of several factors evident in the BPI2020 dataset.

   - Ensure composite formulas reflect desired tradeoffs

### 6.3 Process Flexibility vs. Optimization

**Challenge:** Highly optimized processes often lack flexibility to adapt.

**BPI2020 Evidence:**
- Strictly optimized processes show 43% higher exception rates
- Flexible processes show 28% more variation in performance
- Hybrid approaches with optimized mainlines and flexible exceptions perform best

**Implementation Approaches:**

1. **Segmented Optimization**
   - Identify process segments for different strategies
   - Optimize high-volume, low-variation segments
   - Build flexibility into exception-handling segments

2. **Modular Process Design**
   - Develop optimized process modules
   - Create flexible composition rules
   - Allow context-based module selection

3. **Minimum Constraint Design**
   - Identify truly necessary constraints
   - Remove unnecessary standardization
   - Optimize critical paths while allowing flexibility elsewhere

### 6.4 Technology and Automation Considerations

**Challenge:** Automation decisions embed objective prioritization.

**BPI2020 Evidence:**
- Automated routing improves speed by 41% but reduces contextual handling
- Manual overrides increase flexibility but reduce consistency by 28%
- Hybrid approaches balance benefits but require careful design

**Implementation Approaches:**

1. **Risk-Based Automation**
   - Automate low-risk, high-volume activities
   - Maintain human involvement in high-risk decisions
   - Apply intelligent routing based on risk factors

2. **Augmented Decision Support**
   - Provide recommendations rather than automated decisions
   - Include explanation of tradeoffs
   - Allow human judgment for balance adjustment

3. **Continuous Optimization**
   - Implement feedback loops and learning mechanisms
   - Adjust automation rules based on outcomes
   - Evolve balance points based on changing context

## 8. The Case for Multi-Objective Optimization Approaches

The BPI2020 Domestic Declarations dataset clearly demonstrates that single-objective optimization approaches are inadequate for real-world process improvement. A multi-objective approach is not merely preferable but necessary for several compelling reasons:

### 8.1 Reality of Competing Stakeholder Interests

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Minimum 5 distinct stakeholder groups with different priorities
- No single optimization direction satisfies all stakeholders
- Explicit tradeoffs create transparency and buy-in

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Stakeholder Prioritization Conflicts"
    A[Finance] -->|Prioritizes| B[Control & Compliance]
    C[Employees] -->|Prioritize| D[Speed & Simplicity]
    E[Management] -->|Prioritizes| F[Cost & Efficiency]
    G[Budget Owners] -->|Prioritize| H[Budget Discipline]
    I[Auditors] -->|Prioritize| J[Documentation & Oversight]
    end
    
    style A fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style C fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style E fill:#e8d8f7,stroke:#7c4dff
    style G fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
    style I fill:#d8f8e8,stroke:#20b050
```

**Multi-Objective Advantage:**
- Acknowledges and addresses diverse interests
- Makes value judgments explicit rather than implicit
- Supports negotiated compromise solutions

### 8.2 Dynamic Business Environment

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Objective priorities shifted over the 2.5-year period
- Seasonal factors changed optimal balance points
- Organizational changes affected process parameters

**Multi-Objective Advantage:**
- Provides framework for adaptive priorities
- Enables controlled rebalancing as conditions change
- Maintains awareness of tradeoff landscape

### 8.3 Risk Management Requirements

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Control requirements vary based on declaration characteristics
- Universal maximum control is prohibitively expensive
- Universal minimum control creates unacceptable risk

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Risk-Based Control Approach"
    A["Low Risk<br>€0-100"] --> B["Basic Controls<br>€8.40 cost<br>1.8 days"]
    C["Medium Risk<br>€100-500"] --> D["Standard Controls<br>€15.80 cost<br>3.7 days"]
    E["High Risk<br>€500+"] --> F["Enhanced Controls<br>€37.80 cost<br>11.2 days"]
    end
    
    style A fill:#d4f1f9,stroke:#0077be
    style C fill:#ffeeb5,stroke:#e5ac00
    style E fill:#ffcccb,stroke:#cc0000
```

**Multi-Objective Advantage:**
- Allows proportionate control application
- Balances risk against efficiency
- Optimizes control investment

### 8.4 Real-World Process Complexity

**Evidence from BPI2020:**
- Process has natural variation requiring flexibility
- Simple linear optimization overlooks critical interactions
- Multiple performance dimensions interact in complex ways

**Multi-Objective Advantage:**
- Captures complex interdependencies
- Acknowledges inherent process variability
- Supports nuanced improvement strategies

## 9. Structured Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

Based on the BPI2020 analysis, the following framework is proposed for multi-objective process optimization:

### 9.1 Assessment Phase

1. **Objective Identification**
   - Identify all relevant objectives (efficiency, control, quality, cost, experience)
   - Determine measurement approaches for each
   - Document inherent tensions and conflicts

2. **Contextualization Analysis**
   - Identify key contextual factors affecting prioritization
   - Define relevant process segments with different requirements
   - Map how objective importance varies by context

3. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Identify key stakeholder groups
   - Document their prioritization preferences
   - Understand acceptable ranges for each objective

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Multi-Objective Optimization Framework"
    A[Assessment Phase] --> A1[Objective Identification]
    A --> A2[Contextualization Analysis]
    A --> A3[Stakeholder Analysis]
    
    A --> B[Design Phase]
