# System Form and Function: BPI2020 Domestic Declarations

## Overview

The BPI2020 Domestic Declarations dataset was collected from an **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system** specifically focused on financial declaration processing within an organization. Based on the data patterns, field structures, and process flows, we can infer the following about the system that collected this data.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Financial Declaration Module**
   - Form-based submission interface for employees
   - Document attachment capabilities
   - Validation rules engine
   - Workflow management system
   - Approval routing mechanism
   - Payment processing integration

2. **User Interface Layers**
   - Employee submission portal
   - Administration review dashboard
   - Approver interfaces (Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre-approver)
   - Payment processing console

3. **Database Structure**
   - Case management tables
   - Activity logging system
   - User role definitions
   - Budget reference data
   - Payment tracking

### Technical Indicators from the Data

The system appears to be using:
- **Event logging framework** that captures each process step with timestamps
- **Role-based access control** (RBOC) with well-defined user roles
- **Case identifier system** that links activities to specific declarations
- **Reference data integration** for budget numbers and declaration numbers
- **Automated workflow transitions** between human and system activities

## System Functions

### Primary Functions

1. **Declaration Submission**
   - Captures declaration details including amounts
   - Links to budgets
   - Generates unique identifiers
   - Assigns to appropriate approval workflows

2. **Multi-level Approval Processing**
   - Routes declarations based on amount thresholds and business rules
   - Enforces segregation of duties
   - Provides rejection/return capabilities at each stage
   - Records approval decisions with timestamps

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Interfaces with payment systems
   - Generates payment requests
   - Records payment execution
   - Updates declaration status

4. **Audit and Compliance**
   - Maintains complete audit trails of all activities
   - Preserves approval chains and decisions
   - Records all system and user actions

### Secondary Functions

1. **Reporting Capabilities**
   - Likely provides status tracking for declarations
   - Management dashboards for approval bottlenecks
   - Financial reporting on declaration amounts

2. **Budget Integration**
   - Links declarations to budget numbers
   - Potentially validates against available budget

3. **User Management**
   - Maintains role definitions (Employee, Supervisor, etc.)
   - Enforces authorization levels

## Data Collection Methodology

The system collects data through:

1. **Transactional Logging**
   - Every significant action is recorded as an event
   - Each event includes:
     - Unique identifier (`id`)
     - Resource information (`org:resource`)
     - Activity name (`concept:name`)
     - Timestamp (`time:timestamp`)
     - User role (`org:role`)
     - Case reference (`case:id`, `case:concept:name`)
     - Financial details (`case:BudgetNumber`, `case:DeclarationNumber`, `case:Amount`)

2. **Process Mining Ready Format**
   - Data is structured in an event log format suitable for process mining
   - Each row represents a distinct activity within a case
   - Clear case identifiers and timestamps enable process reconstruction

## System Behavior Insights

From the dataset structure and content, we can infer:

1. **Structured Workflow Implementation**
   - The system enforces defined process paths but allows for variations
   - Multiple approval paths exist based on declaration characteristics
   - System activities (like payment handling) are automated

2. **Role-Based Routing**
   - Different user roles have specific activities they can perform
   - The system routes work items to appropriate roles
   - Approval hierarchies are enforced

3. **Declaration Lifecycle Management**
   - Declarations have a complete lifecycle from submission to payment
   - Statuses are tracked implicitly through activities
   - All case-related activities reference the same amount, suggesting consistency enforcement

## System Evolution Indicators

The dataset spans from January 2017 to June 2019, showing:

1. **Consistent Process Structure**
   - Core activities remain consistent throughout the period
   - Role definitions remain stable

2. **Possible System Maturity**
   - The process appears well-established with clear patterns
   - The presence of multiple variants suggests a flexible system that accommodates different business needs

## Conclusion

The system that collected the BPI2020 Domestic Declarations dataset appears to be a mature, workflow-driven financial declaration processing module within an ERP system. It provides comprehensive tracking of the entire declaration lifecycle from submission through approval to payment, with strong audit capabilities and role-based access controls. The structured nature of the data indicates a well-designed system with clear business rules and process definitions.
